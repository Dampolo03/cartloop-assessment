# Getting Started with the Cartloop Assessment App

This is a simple SPA with React that simulates a text message conversation between two or more people.

## First Step

Clone the repo:

### `git clone https://github.com/Dampolo03/cartloop-assessment.git`

## Second Step

In the project directory, run the following commands:

### 2.1

To install all dependencies:

### `npm i`

### 2.2

To run the app in the development mode. This simultaneously runs the application in localhost port `3000` and also runs a local mock websocket server in port `8000`:

### `npm run dev`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser after compilation.

### 2.3

To launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm test`

### 2.4

To build the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run build`
